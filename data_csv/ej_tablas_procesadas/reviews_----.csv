About five stars and years after that debacle, I revisited with a gift card in hand, and was glad I did. Price not an issue, I still gravitated towards the 39.95 prix fixe menu and basically had a 6oz. filet with all the fixins. There were four of us, and service was seamless offering to hold our sunglasses until after our meal lest we lose them in the meaty throw down about to ensue. The reason I'm carelessly blowin' a good five stars is because my filet was cooked precisely to temperature, and was sizzling madly in a pond of butter on my plate upon arrival. I enjoyed the flavor of everything that crossed my ravenous face hole. The place was immaculate, and the service slaughtered it. It may not be the best of the best steak in all of Tampaland, BUT if the service is like this all the time, then it's certainly tasty enough for me. Steak always tastes better when sprinkled heavily with flawless service." ,2014-11-16 01:23:45 ,Sunday   ,Tampa       ,PA    ,      33607 ,"27.9573809395,-82.5247961283"

We were seated fairly close to the kitchen and the level of organization and attention to detail exhibited there is evident in the final product. Many restaurants do not know how to cook a piece of salmon correctly, but mine was excellent, very moist and beautifully seasoned. We had some flatbread to begin with and that was very tasty as well. Service was good and our server was knowledgeable and pleasant, we will definitely be back!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,2018-05-14 17:00:21 ,Monday   ,Cherry Hill ,PA    ,      08002 ,"39.9403603389,-75.0264621411"

We went back after the first time because the service was so great.  So far I've liked everything I've eaten but the service is what really stands out.  There was a long wait on Valentine's Day and the waitress comped our appetizers without us asking or complaining.  She simply asked if we had a long wait and we said yes but said it was fine and she came back with an adjusted bill.  She also took one of the appetizers back (again without us asking) because she felt that it was a little skimpy.  Now THAT is service.  I will definitely be back.  Overall very good, nice ambiance, GREAT drinks (they're strong) and amazing staff."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,2016-07-08 20:56:56 ,Friday   ,Cherry Hill ,PA    ,      08002 ,"39.9403603389,-75.0264621411"
