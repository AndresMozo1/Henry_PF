They don't let you use your cell in the restaurant. Great local beer! We went during one of the parades so didn't have to wait on line. I wish I could stay another day so I could eat there again!,2018-02-09 04:22:31

The fact they sell pizza by the slice is cool, but I will say there are a lot of other pizza places in U-city one should try out before eating here. 

The interior is small and seems like it's designed to get people in and out the door. The staff is nice and facility is pretty clean.",2015-02-16 00:36:51

Decorated well for a place in a strip mall. Wasn't sure at first when we walked in. It took a bit for us to be acknowledged, but understood because the servers were also host. We had very good service and the food was surprisingly good. Starter of Saganaki.  Fried cheese always good. Husband got Chicken Riganato ( it was the closest thing to Chicken Souvlaki) with potatoes and green beans. I got a Gyro wrap minus lettuce and tomato with sauce on the side & French Fries. He said the chicken wa better than our favorite Greek Restaurant. I tried his potato and it was good. We both stayed clear of the green beans. We both hate cooked onions. Gyro wrap was great. French fries were just your basic fry. In all great meal and service and will try to make it back.",2019-09-01 20:16:08

We sat outside on the awesome patio. Covid precautions made us feel safe. The salsas were amazing! If they were bottled we would have taken them home. Drinks were fresh. The carne in the skirt steak fajitas was tender and enough to take home. Can't wait to return,2020-09-26 22:20:08

After four hours driving  in the car, we wanted to get lunch and stretch our legs.   This subway  location only has a drive thru and has their lobby closed.  Not certain if it was due to the holiday weekend or a new policy.   We chose to find an alternative eating establishment to meet our requirement to not eat in the car.  Just want to warn you as this location is a little off the road to get to and the frontage road doesn't allow you to directly turn back towards the main road.",2015-07-05 17:49:05
