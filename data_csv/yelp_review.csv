I had a bad experience with the staff. If was our anniversary, and my boss sent us champagne and strawberry's. They delivered it to us, and then called later and said don't open it...wth? They mistakenly gave us too expensive of a bottle and picked up that bottle and gave us a different bottle. We had to wait for them and they made us late to our dinner reservation. The difference in the bottle price was very minimal. Such a weird experience. The dinner at the steakhouse was very good..props to them! The maid walked into our room without knocking and we were like do you need something? She said it was a mistake? Again a very awkward situation. Upon checkout I discovered that the Bellman had dropped my makeup case, and broke it and several items in it. I called and they basically said there was no footage so I am SOL :/ Very disappointed. We have been guests before and did have a very good experience."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,2015-05-27 22:32:17

The food was very good and kids meals were very reasonably priced ($7 for meal plus drink). The view was fantastic and great service too. Our server, Sarah, was very attentive and friendly and sweet!  We had a great time. The view is fantastic in the ""golden hour"" before sunset.

It had a very tasty chipolte sauce in it, which added that extra punch. One thing I really liked, was how it was served. Cut in half and in cups! Very neat and didn't get messy."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,2014-05-12 08:35:09

Some of the rooms in the haunted house smell terrible. The actors are pretty good but not the best I've seen. To me it's very pricey for what you get. The lines for the first 2 attractions went fairly quick but the third line took about 2 hours to get through and it wasn't even halfway full only about 2 rows of the 8 rows they have setup. I probably wouldn't go back. It's one of those one and done type of places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,2015-10-13 20:13:06

They easily accommodate many large groups and have a beautiful presentation. The variety of food is cooked well. On regular Sundays the cost is $25 pp & for $5 more add endless mimosas. On holidays like Mother's Day it's $40pp & they only give 1 mimosa pp complimentary. They offer so much variety it's difficult to try something from every area from kid friendly sliders & mac n cheese, to oysters on the half shell, shrimp & prime rib. The Resort is an old building elegantly decorated and reminiscent of old Safety Harbor rich with history. I personally appreciate that you pay the cashiers before entering into the brunch area.

Dont eat the chicken kabobs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,2018-10-06 19:17:23

Halloween is my anniversary, and every year my partner and I try to go somewhere new every year to celebrate. This year I came across Xochitl's Dias de los Muertos four course $35 prixe fixe menu, and we decided to go!
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Sopas - My partner had the Pozole de Conejo (Rabbit) and I had the Caldo de Gallina y Masa (Chicken and Masa). They were good, but I did not have a single Masa dumpling in my soup... I was a little bummed.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Antojitos - My partner had the Gorditas Infladas con Frijoles y Queso Panela and I had the Escabeche de Guajalote. I was pleased with my dish, but my partner was not pleased with his.

AMAZING! We both loved these dishes!

Mine was so / so and my partner only had a taste of his... They were not that great.

The service was slow and our waiter did not seem like he was interested in being at work. We are definitely going to go back, but we are ordering from the main menu and we are making sure we have a different waiter / waitress."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ,2009-11-03 19:36:19

The best thing is that the tours are completely free! I have been multiple times and love going each time. The tours last about 45 mins to an hour and are very informative. The tour guide takes you through the entire brew process from start to finish and answers any questions you may have. The tour guide also gave little bits of history about the Budweiser company that I found very interesting.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            At the end of the tour you are given three free samples of anything they have on tap. In the tap room when I went they have lots of options to include Stella, Shocktop, ect.  in additional to your traditional Budlight. We even got to taste one of their new beers which was really cool.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            This year I even had the pleasure of going to the Budweiser Brewery Lights Experience. This was completely amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who is in the area during the holiday season. The entire brewery is lit up with lights and Christmas themed decor. Throughout the brewery there are different activities for both adults and kids to keep everyone entertained. Upon arrival to the event you are given 5 tickets you can redeem for samples throughout the brewery. These samples included ciders, Stella, and a few other good beers as well. In addition to all this they also have bar food available such as brats, pretzels, chili all served fresh with plenty of seating inside the beer garden. Again, I highly recommend that everyone checks out this brewery!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,2017-12-25 23:41:04

I was impressed at how juicy and buttery it was so we made a date to go in person.  We were here two weeks ago on a Wednesday of course, and we were both disappointed in the quality of meat. I had asked for mine as rare as it could possibly be and my co-worker asked for it with the dry rub crusted on it. They came out very chewy and his was not crusted and mine was medium well. We both had two drinks and the bill came to $50 something. Not worth it in my opinion."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,2019-10-18 01:56:27

The half shell oysters where delicious and strait from the sea fresh! The Alligator was well seasoned and tender along with the calamari. Where can you go to get a dozen of huge oysters for I think $5. Staff was attentive and nice. And the wait wasn't long at all.

It was busy but not crazy, we sat right away. The service was HORRIBLE. We were there for almost 3 hours. We had to ask the waiter multiple times for things we asked for, like drinks and bread (easy things). We all got apps and one of our friends apps didn't come out and we had to ask him twice for it. The food came out an hour after we ordered it. Bottom line is I will never come back again. The food was okay, but the service ruined my experience."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,2018-01-20 19:55:43

I found A Salon and Spa through my best girl, Lindsay. A friend of her's from elementary school had recently started working here (Christy).
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            I must admit, I was quite nervous my first time in the chair here, only because my stylist was a recent graduate from cosmetology school.  Not to discount anyones's skills, of course. I'm generally nervous when anyone new cuts my hair; this just added to it

She knew I was nervous so she made sure she had plenty of time to deal with my outrageousness.

Christy is officially my one and only. She does a great job and is always willing to listen to what I want and provide feedback if needed.

It has a warm feeling about it and everyone is extremely friendly.

While they both had a good flavor to them, they tasted watered down.  They didn't have that creamy taste that most cream syrups have.
                                                                                                            I found them to be on the expensive side.  $4.75 for a medium snow ball with condensed milk is higher than most places.

                                                                                                            But we were shocked that the projector that was used for our screening was so sub-par. It wasn't nearly bright/powerful enough to project in a space that size, so the film looked like it was shot completely at night. Some shots were so dark you couldn't see faces or detail at all. To think that we paid hundreds of dollars to use a crappy projector for a few hours...
                                                                                                            Given Penn's reputation as a top-notch institution (and Annenberg's, too) we really didn't think this sort of gaff was a possibility.

I had the curry chicken. It was interesting. LOTS of sauteed onions with chicken and peanuts. (So many onions--I was overwhelmed.) The sauce wasn't spicy at all, and there wasn't a lot of it. I think I was expecting it to be more like an Indian curry, so my let down might be entirely my own fault.

My friend and I used to come here just because their multigrains are so yummy (and their plains have the same oniony? but not oniony? flavored awesomeness that goes with every meal you could get). If you get a warm slice it totally makes your day.

Great for togo lunches when you're powering through your day, but it still just tastes like fast food.

At least my favorite in all of New Orleans.  I've been in love with this fine neighborhood institution for 5 years, and the love just grows stronger.

The addition of the inside dining area has helped relieve the crowding issues they were starting to have.  But honestly, I don't mind sharing tables with other parties and I find that to be one of the charming features of this place.

I always thought not to bring my new AMG vehicle to machine using car wash because of scratch concerns but I gave it a try because I had a 1 month free coupon and MB fort washington actually recommends this car wash. I even saw S65 AMG (a quarter million dollar car) getting detailed here. Seriously no other car wash does better exterior job than this car wash. I honestly dont like how they take 9 dollars on interior vacuum because other carwashes just do it for free but it doesnt matter because I can vacuum myself for $1.50 I'll just call this a good sale stretegy. No one wants to vacuum 200 cars a day. I had that nightmare. (Im a former carwash employee) I unfortunately dont carry around cash and feel bit sorry for not paying tips but in return I actually get out of my car and dry wipe side sills myself lol.  Im planning to return to this car wash even after my free carwash expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,2016-04-03 16:06:20

John went out of his way to make sure he did! I appreciated his efforts to ensure that I had a good experience regardless of whether I bought a car or not. I had a great experience and like not having to spend the entire that at the dealership! Looking forward to having my car delivered! I will add that picture when it happens.

If I hadn't received 5 star service and John's willingness to match their price and my willingness to wait for inventory, I would have driven down the road and be in my car right now. Hope you appreciate that I am willing to wait for you guys to get me my car just to give you the business. It would be disappointing not to get my car on Monday."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,2020-02-15 19:51:12

I was thirsty, but  wanted to try out something different and fresh. I came upon this sangria they had promoting on their TV screen. Look delicious so I ordered one. Have to say, it was refreshing and delicious. Aside from the fact it was weekend and I wanted to unwind a bit, this came to be a good choice. I love the fact that fruits were included in the drink. Definitely recommend this drink if you are in the mood for something fresh and delicious.

Hemming's not only does their tostones good, but they do an awesome job in adding that pork meat, cilantro, and sauce. The flavor is outstanding. Keeping the Cuban tradition with a little added flavor.

By then, I wasn't really in the mood to play games, and I was extremely grateful that I didn't order food myself.

I wouldn't go to this place again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,2016-03-01 19:42:09

At first glance the buffalo chicken dip looks a little strange but it's a new place and everyone does things differently. NOPE! It tasted like straight oil! 3 bites in and I threw it in the trash. Caesar salad came with Italian dressing not Caesar, and the wings are so over cooked and lacking sauce. So disappointed. This used to be my go to place for wings, time to look elsewhere. Don't waste your time going here, spend the extra 10-15 minutes and get your food from a bar in Doylestown or the Pineville!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,2018-04-25 00:10:35

Start with seafood wonton soup, a miso-like broth brimming with ginger-filled dumplings, or curried chicken ravioli with grilled eggplant. What seem to be odd combinations prove to be inventive, and delicious, creations - smoked duck with endive, spicy shrimp with sweet pear curry, sesame seed-encrusted halibut filet with crunchy French beans and tomatoes in a lemongrass sauce. Noodle dishes and stir-fries are impressive. One area where they really shine is one usually ignored by Asian eateries - dessert. Ginger creme with strawberries, hazelnut meringue with milk chocolate and champagne-poached kumquats, and fresh mango and blueberry cake are options that warrant serious consideration. As glamorous the decor and delectable the cuisine are, this loses a star for its far too small portions at much too high prices. Heaping more on the plate or lowering the tab probably would make this a more frequent destination instead of an occasional special event."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,2005-09-23 15:57:14

We came in a bit late and were able to snag a nice booth at the front of the restaurant. I absolutely love the ambiance. It's modern and romantic, and they have a gigantic bar that is lovely.

We got a delicious bottle of pinot for $36.00! Excellent.

The crostino was amazing but the wagyu beef was a tad bit overcooked. Just a tiny bit.

The blueberry lasagna is a must try if you like mushrooms, it's not sweet, definitely savory and rich. It was unlike anything I've had before and I loved it! I'd highly recommend the black spaghetti as well, it had lobster in the sauce and was out of this world!!

YUM. For only $3 a scoop, it was the perfect end to the meal.

With a somewhat limited selection, and slightly higher prices, they're not my all time favorite. But, time after time, I find myself coming here because they're just so damn friendly and convenient. Brian is really great. I bought my first new bike (all the previous ones were hand me downs) here. At the time I didn't know much about what I was looking for. Brian helped me find a bike that fit correctly and was pretty much exactly what I was looking for.

I would avoid buying a complete bike again, and instead build one myself. And I'm sure that Bicycle Revolutions could help me do that. But all in all, they're a great shop, and are largely responsible for getting me into such a wonderful activity. Oh and I just bought my helmet here! Good selection and they helped me find one that fit.

Each time I go to purchase a car I always look at the Cadillac, but when it comes time to make a decision I end up choosing another car. This is always a decision I end up with regretting in the long run. But finally we settled on a Cadillac, and Ken was very helpful. He made the buying experience enjoyable and comfortable for us. This was the best experience we had at a dealership to date. We went looking for the best deal on miles per gallon, and we came home with the best deal on smiles per gallon. Not only the vehicle, but the experience was worth every penny. I would recommend this vehicle, the dealership and Ken anyone, anytime."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,2013-02-03 12:22:23

I get my hair cut maybe twice a year, or when I notice the ends really drying out.  Last haircut I received was in February, and the girl (at a different salon) cut above brow bangs when I asked for her to angle my hair.  I remember my face turned beet red and my entire body broke out in a cold sweat.  Luckily, I loved the idea of bangs (even though they were poorly cut), but I was nervous to attempt it again.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Allison, one of Rodney Mitchell's hair dressers, eased all of my worries.  She and I immediately showed each other pictures of our pups, and talked about places to go out since I just moved into town a few months ago.  And that was just her personality.  Her skills as a hair stylist were just as wonderful.  She took her time on each section of my hair, asked me how I wanted my bangs handled, and even cut them little by little so I wouldn't have a repeat of my last hair cut.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            After she blow-dried my hair, she sat there and continued to perfect the haircut by walking around and fixing the ""loose ends"" so to speak.  She took such time and care with my hair, I felt like she knew me.  I walked out of there with the biggest smile on my face.  It was the best overall haircut experience I have ever had.  My hair bounced as I walked, but that could've been the haircut or the new bounce in my step due to my new found confidence.  I'd like to think it was both.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Some people reviewed this place to be pretentious or NYC meets CMT, but I'd beg to differ.  The decor on the walls is very earthy and casual.  And the tin wall hangings are really cool!  I thought the staff was friendly, helpful and efficient.  Nowhere did I see or hear a pretentious comment or anything remotely close to it.

That is to say, she is somewhat idiosyncratic but simultaneously afraid of committing a faux-pas that would be devastating in the presence of her  friends but completely undetectable to us.  Her fiancé was equally challenging.

Even better is marrying a chef who has chef friends, which I managed to do in March. Lucky us, one thoughtful chef friend gave us a gift card as a wedding gift to any of John Besh's restaurants, 3 of which are in New Orleans, where we honeymooned.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            We chose to go to Lüke, because it seemed the most ""us"". The restaurant is lovely inside, and feels intimate because there are several rooms, even though the space is quite large when you combine all the spaces. We were led back to the room near the kitchen, which might annoy some people, but for us, being able to look through a large plate glass window at the goings-on was added entertainment.

                                                                                                            A symphony of pork, rabbit and other delicious things. Paté, head cheese, fois gras terrine, house-pickled watermelon rind and other pickles, stone ground mustard and plenty of toasts.

Seriously.

                                                                                                            Yes, there's lettuce, but the giant chunks of bacon and the most succulent fried oysters I've ever eaten sit atop this lettuce, and they don't skimp.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Mussels and frietes
                                                                                                            I think this was like, 2 pounds of mussels in the best broth I've ever had. The fries were good but I enjoyed dunking the crusty bread that came with the salad and the waitress happily brought more. I think the kitchen staff was sort of amazed watching me eat ALL of this, and I am still not quite sure how I did it either. But I really like mussels.

                                                                                                            This thing was huge, the bacon on it was amazing, and husband enjoyed finishing it back at the townhouse as a latenight snack.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            The service here was amazing. Our waitress was so friendly, patient and answered all our questions thoroughly. We could see the amazing efficiency and care in the kitchen, and the sommelier visited with tables and made suggestions clearly loves his job. It was a very lovely meal, and even without the gift card, would have been worth every penny -- though honestly I think this is a very affordable and accessible dining experience even for those who don't think they like fine dining. I think it's no accident Lüke is located in the financial district. I am sure they get lots of business people in there for lunch and dinner.

I brought my car in to have a look over due to my mileage a creeping over 125,000 and a slow oil leak. I left my car and within a few hours Tom called to discuss a list of items to review. He broke it down into options for me listing what he would do today if it was his car, what I had time to do but should start thinking about doing in the next 6-12 months with pricing. Tom knew what I wanted before I could even ask for it.

Tom told me to come after work. This was a Friday night and he stayed late to work with me. He did some research on the light and even called my dealership to press the issue of why they weren't covering a replacement for possible faulty sensor light they fixed due to a recall a few months earlier.  Tom treats you like a good friend the moment you walk in his door."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,2016-02-27 00:59:43

The place was uncomfortably warm and very loud.

The portion was good but the price  of the salad, $9 ,was a bit pricey.

The burger came with fries. I must admit it was one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had. It was cooked fresh and it was very juicy.  The french fries were cooked crispy and they were seasoned perfectly. A very tasty meal indeed.

Thank you to Gianna for being patient and super friendly with all of our question about the menu. She was sweet and friendly. I wish they had a location in South Jersey but I would definitely go back when I'm in Philly again. Give the arugula taco salad a try and the kale lemonade! I'm not vegan or vegetarian yet, but choices like this menu persuade me to transition haha

I was heading out of town on a holiday weekend on a race and had only rescued my Malshi just recently. I was nervous and full of trepidation. She asked all the right questions, provided paperwork for me to read and sign about his care and her business, and even had me bring him buy to meet her.
                                                                                                            She was willing to adapt to my schedule and was very reasonable with pricing. She sent me photos by day, assured me he was doing well, and even bathed him since he was running and playing and had gotten dirty. I was extremely impressed by her care of him and her ability to help us both feel at ease. She welcomed him into her dog family and helped him have a great stay twice  now. I enjoy the personal service and the lack of a whole mess of dogs where he would get lost. She is incredibly patient with my boy who is very protective of me, and was very understanding. I am so thankful to have found her!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,2014-09-28 23:31:59

And I say unforgettable because I went here approximately 10 months ago, and I just got around to writing my review, and I still remember exactly what I got.

I prefer bacon of the turkey persuasion wherever applicable. And it was great. Nay, it was PERFECT.

We had to wait a while for a table, and our stomachs were eating themselves about 15 minutes into our wait, but it was worth it.

My only real complaint is that I didn't have more room in my stomach to order more. Yes, that's my ONLY REAL COMPLAINT.

Would try another breakfast item next time - or simply order more Boughnuts!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,2020-10-01 13:05:50

When I tried to pick it up it got the run around about them not being able to find my keys. Finally went down there because no one would call me back.

And Daniel explained that what his text should have said was ""your jeep is ready, you can take it today. Or tmrw when it's all nice and cleaned up"". I explained the grammatical differences between the two sentences and that punctuation actually changes the meaning of them.

The beer came in a frosty mug which was a nice touch and super refreshing! We both liked our meals and the portions were very large. The chips were warm and we were told when seated that they were in the process of making more. The chips and salsa was particularly good and fresh. The flavors really stood out in the carne asada. Big robust flavor as my husband put it, lol.

When we left around 8:30am,  there was a line out the door and around the street.  My advice is to get there early! I had the Santa Fe Pancakes which were very unique,  and surprisingly good if you're up for something different.  The rest of the food was just like any other breakfast place.  Can't rave about it, but also can't complain.  Service was on point.  Atmosphere was a little loud,  but that doesn't bother me.  Large menu with lots of options, prices fair.

I was so excited to hear that the original owners of Sk Noodle were back and opening up a new restaurant.  I have been a long time customer of theirs... and as soon as I walked in she immediately recognized me and gave me a huge hug!  I was so pleased! !! So as usual I sit down, the place has been totally revamped  and brightened up from the dark Thai restaurant it once was. The tables and Chairs are classic and clean. The ambiance is perfect for casual lunch/dinner dates . I ordered the spring rolls to start.... delicious and I love that they use dark green lettuce instead of iceberg which some  places do alot of here in Reno. Then came the #4. Rare beef and flank. I was craving Pho all week so this hit the spot. Their broth was delicious and fresh, the flank didn't have sooooo much fat on it that you couldn't eat it. It was tender amd almost fell apart in your mouth. All in all I was very pleased and satisfied with my visit to their new restaurant.  I will definitely be back!  Oh Also I saw the lunch menu..... a must check out and try!!!!!!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,2016-05-24 18:49:53

The biggest problem is that they bake their own hoagie rolls in store instead of buying rolls from Amoroso. Amoroso rolls were perfect. The rolls baked in store do not compare even when cooked perfectly. But many times the rolls are overcooked making them even worse. The hoagies are still good, but you can get better ones elsewhere close by and there was a time when you couldn't say that, especially about the tuna hoagie."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,2018-11-15 14:39:41

Most times the wait staff is really good and they know the menu. My wife has a pretty bad shellfish allergy which we bring to their attention. Usually, they make sure her meal is not contaminated and that is much appreciated. However, the last two times we were there she had a problem. The result we stopped going.

This place is absolutely terrible. The host/hostess are so unprofessional and miserable. We first got seated after about 15 minutes of no one paying us any attention, then to get seated and never have a server come over. I had to get up to go find a server. We then had to wait about 20 minutes before we got our drinks.  The food was absolutely terrible. It was barely cooked and had no flavor.  We then went up to the patio bar after we ate to again wait another 20 minutes before someone even approached us. (And this is after making complete full on eye contact numerous times). The bartender was so rude and ignorant (her name is Tiffany). I have never in my life experienced what I experienced at this place this past weekend. Every single person that works there is so cocky, ignorant and rude.  It's so unbelievable. Asked for a manger as well, and they never came over to us to hear our complaints.

So it is a convenient location. But that's about it on the plus side. The parking lot is horrible. There is just not enough parking for a Walmart in that area. Tarpon Springs is a great place, but this store brings out the scum of the surrounding areas. I don't feel safe if I have to make a Walmart run after 9pm. Besides a select few cashiers that are really nice, there is no assistance at all. The site to store pickup is horrible. I sat there 25 minutes before I had to demand another employee (who was just standing there behind the desk playing on his telxon) to radio the site to store person to get my order. That employee who was just standing behind the desk doesn't do much of anything whenever I'm in there, and I can't figure out what he does. I don't even think he knows what his job is, but it's clearly not helping customers. What finally pushed me over the edge to write this review was that I bought some meat yesterday and unfortunately I forgot to look at the expiration date which was that day. This upsets me because this is not the first, second, third, or fourth time this has happened at this store with food items. Now I have to inconveniently go back and exchange the meat. I think it's now worth driving to the Trinity location since I've never had a problem there." ,2017-04-18 17:08:12

I took my family to Bennihanna's in Plymouth Meeting for my wife's birthday. The food is overpriced (they charged me $2.60 for a child's milk), the service is slow and inattentive, and the chef was inexperienced and not entertaining.  Normally I overlook these issues, but when a restaurant charges $30 - $40 for an entree, I expect an exceptional dinning experience on par with a Sullivan's, Morton's, or Capital Grille.  Bennihanna's was anything but exceptional, and to cap it off the manager solicits your address and email information at the end of the meal.  Totally cheesy!  In the Plymouth Meeting/King of Prussia area there are about 10 hibachi restaurants (all less expensive than Bennihanna), so there is no lack of competition.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this Bennihanna location out of business within the next 12 months.  They will get the movie crowd from the neighboring AMC, but I can't imagine them getting any repeat business."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,2009-08-29 00:11:11

Today I decided to bring a friend here for the first time thinking I'd get the same experience. I was wrong. To start its Sunday and I guess the game takes precedence over any customer. The hostess tried to seat me and my friend in a sad corner away from anyone else as if we were diseased or something but seated us at a table only after I expressed my feeling about being seated away. The server while friendly forgot my friends order and brought his order late. We had made it known right up front we weren't here to see football but it seems we should have as other customers were recently being helped more than us. It seems ridiculous that we got handed a happy hour menu only to be told there's no happy hour because of the game. I'm so embarrassed that I brought my friend here after I told him this was a cool spot to hang out at. This is the last time I set foot here.

No refunds just empty credits. I feel bad for staff that gets yelled at infront of custoners for things they didnt do especially when ive come in and seen it first hand . soda is always out. Never stocked. Floors r filthy. Dough is not fresh at all. Its mostly almost frozen then quickly defrosted. Cross contamination. 100%  food safety precautions are not takrn what so ever. Ceo of marcos needs to look deeply into this store and see hpw the stores owner treats employees and ex employees. Ignorong them refusing to serve them or communicate without a ban notice.

The pancakes are rock hard and lack flavor. I remember being an undergraduate in Nashville in the late 1990's and I always loved going to Pancake Pantry. Sadly, the length of the wait line is the only aspect of this restaurant that remains. Try Biscuit Love's Hillsboro Village location instead."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,2019-08-09 05:17:58

The place is decent sized inside, not too big and not too small. The wait staff moves quite swiftly, they're getting you in and out.

If it's how you like your coffee, be sure to ask for half and half because they supply milk on the table. I kept it simple and ordered a half order (3) of their buttermilk pancakes. Note: you can half any order of pancakes. My mom got the bacon eggs and subbed out the pancakes for the hashbrowns. The hashbrowns were excellent, crispy and hot!

They did have live music but it was pretty packed and hard to maneuver around.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ,2016-04-10 19:21:41

The staff was not too helpful in explaining the process, or showing us where the bins of tools were or telling us that we had to ""glue"" our pieces on as we go. If you don't know what your doing, you will end up setting up your glass pieces twice like we did... The positives - the selection of pre-cut glass was abundant and there was no one else at the table so we had lots of room! They have gloves available so children don't cut their hands.

The cost for two small squares of glass and the sitting fee was $48. If we would have had help in the beginning (and not had to ask for help three times) and my piece hadn't been damaged by someone elses clay project, this would have been five-star glass fusing fun!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,2012-11-27 03:37:27

I'm from Florida and am used to a greater variety of Latin American cuisines, so I was a little disappointed when I moved here a couple years ago and noticed my options were much more limited. Peruvian food is one of my favorite cuisines and Sabor does an excellent job providing great menu options and the things we tried tonight at dinner were executed wonderfully.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            Our meal started with the appetizers Papa a la Huancaina (soft potato slices covered with a yellow, cheesy sauce) and Sabor Causas (2 layers of mashed, lemony and flavorful potatoes with shrimp and avocado in the center and on top), and then we shared the Seafood Combo Entree which came with  good portions of ceviche (citrus marinated raw fish), Jalea (lightly battered and fried fish, calamari, fish, and yuca), and 4 cooked Muscles topped with corn, tomatoes and a ceviche-like sauce. Ceviche was my favorite. I think when we come next we will get the ceviche again but as a shared appetizer. Each of the other things we tried were also deliciously prepared and we will definitely be coming back soon.
                                                                                                            
                                                                                                            I'd also recommend going on a week day rather than a busy Saturday night at 6:30. It seems as if they didn't expect to be nearly full and there was only 1 waitress for the whole place. She did a great job but some people were visibly irritated while waiting. We didn't mind because we weren't in any hurry and our first appetizer came out 5 minutes after we ordered it so we didn't get hangry. I think it could be attributed to being relatively new and growing pains that'll be worked out.

They also have a fabulous selection of bruschetta - i recommend the ricotta, pistachio & honey.
