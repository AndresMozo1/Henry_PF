I'm not sure if my room was uncharacteristically awful (we do have a corporate discount) or if people are just so blown away by the kitsch factor and free happy hour that they don't notice the details. When I entered my room it had a damp and musty feel. The decor was disjointed at best with a tacky sheer curtain dragged across a back wall doubling as a ""closet."" This closet had a shelf nailed up over a door to another... room? hallway? portal to hell? The bathroom vanity was stained, chipped and worn away. The minibar was cute faux retro but always locked - and they never gave me the key. Actually a note here, the team behind Kimpton's global and local social media channels are stellar and actually sent someone to unlock the minibar my first night. Unfortunately calls to the front desk on following nights did not yield any results. Overall the fairly large room came across haggard and definitely not on par with other Kimpton properties. I was sent a follow up survey after my stay and based on my responses had a manager reach out to assure me that the hotel knew about these issues and would soon be launching an extensive remodel. I'll hazard a repeat visit post-refurbishment, but until then will stay elsewhere when in DC.",,,0x89b7b7ea845c99b7:0x17e46b5d96f05911

This bar/club has an amazing atmosphere and pulls an extremely diverse crowd.  Drinks are expensive but also poured heavy handedly...which depending may or may not be a good thing.   The outdoor area has another bar and DJ that allows smoking.  It also features a fireplace room, a couch/table service area, a dance floor with live music, another bar on the second floor with live music and sometimes even a third area. So you get it, plenty of space and lots of people.  The place 18th street really shines in keeping the crowd diverse with their changing music nights.  I recommend trying out the club on various nights just to get a taste.

I was Not in the mood to leave my hotel. And I decided to order delivery at the Park at 14th. It was incredibly simple process to place my order over the phone with no wait time. And less than 30 minutes I was greeted by a pleasant gentleman named Joshua. He was friendly and he explained everything that was included in my Park at 14th box, down to the utensils and napkins (if youâ€™ve been following me for a whileâ€¦I always appreciate!).

I made one suggestion to Joshua on his way out. I encouraged The restaurant to consider adding more options for us health-conscious foodies. As for myself, I am a pescatarian but Iâ€™d love to invite family to dine here. A few of them are vegan lovers and vegetarian lovers. Just a suggestion!

Joshua did explain they will take that into consideration but also pulled up the menu options which reflects more than what I thought. **In my opinion...itâ€™s great start ðŸ˜‰",,,0x89b7b795c270e095:0x78e923bd9ff778d6

It's located in NE D.C. near Catholic University alongside railroad tracks. The station itself is large and from my opinion, efficiently run. Despite lines, they get you in and out quickly.

One thing to note is that they don't take dirt or cement blocks.

They also take and give compost at this location.",,,0x89b7c7dc6077277d:0x8510ee662ace1da1

Although you can get a cone from Haagen Daz or Baskin Robins at a lower cost, we strive to create a pure, authentic, and honest product.
