They have this fish-bread stuff they give you when you sit down which comes with two sauces and they are pretty good.  I like eating the green one because it makes me feel like I'm on nickelodeon or something.  Ahhh to be mentally young...

So we sat there and just got water to drink.  My date actually got a mango-yogurt-style drink.  It wasn't what I would call something I would always order, but it was unique and tasty.

I'm not sure what exactly to order but I can tell you that if you order anything with the words ""Tikka Masala"" in it, then it will be simply amazing.  The first time I went I ordered the fish tikka masala.  She ordered the chicken.  She cheated though as she had been here before.  Either way they were both great dishes.  They give you an option of mild, medium or hot.  We both ordered medium.  Mine was more subtle and gentle but still loaded with great flavor.  Her's had some tang to it and a little kick and it was by far the better dish.  It's ok though because I enjoyed some leftovers the next day.   We also shared an order of the Rotti, which is just bread but goes very well with the sauce of your food.

I've since then ordered via livingsocial takeout from them multiple times.  They are cheap, prompt, and very tasty.  Also they give you plenty to eat and you can ask for extra rice and I've never had them actually charge me for it.

If you're skeptical, just think of these dishes as any kind of rice and gravy dish you can think up and then add a touch of love, some seasoning, spice, and happiness to it.  Eat up!",,,0x89b7b8330fc4db81:0xac753592da34e36b
