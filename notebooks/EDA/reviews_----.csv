2488,Seasons 52,QrzYt5rgJxGqH35VPHF1Rw,hJeKsJQt3zlmyYl3RvSu4w,mYMPepp0QIZRk_52pWzeoA,4.0,Went for lunch.  Was nice and quiet after some early morning shopping.  Winter menu is what is being served.  I have been here a couple times and this was by far the best food I have had there.  Chili was good little spicy may not recommend for children even though it is on the kids menu.  Had the scallop special.  Great price for between 6-8 diver scallops.  Was shocked with the amount on the plate as compared to other meals.  Would highly recommend.  Would have loved more sauce with it but the calorie count would have been too high.  Oh well I would still order it again.  Save room for dessert!  The small sweet shots as I call them are perfect for me as I am normally too full to enjoy sweets after a meal. Our server was knowledgeable and had good suggestions. I brought my mother and this is now her favorite restaurant when visiting.  I think we may be coming back to seasons 52 more often after this experience!!!  Well done!,2016-01-19,Tuesday,,Tampa,PA,33609,"27.9463699545,-82.5248121533"

I believe them to have a great beer selection and competitive prices.",2019-05-10,Friday,,King of Prussia,FL,19406,"40.0879239996,-75.3952012584"

The crab cake was the best thing on the table.. both the filet and salmon we're just ""ok"". Truffle Mac was tasteless and Brussel sprouts were nothing to write home about. I'm glad we tried this restaurant so at least we know where not to go if we're looking for excellent food.",2018-02-14,Wednesday,,Tampa,FL,33607,"27.9602024049,-82.5183134644"

Menu is different, as is the food taste. Cant give it a 5 star rating, but surprisingly good. Did t have to wait long, service was good, and the good taste better than I remember.

I had the Chilean sea bass and it was one of the best I've had. This is definitely a great place to go when you're looking to dress up a bit and have just a really enjoyable dinner.,2015-01-05,Monday,,Tampa,FL,33607,"27.9602024049,-82.5183134644"

I really wanted to like it and I put in the effort but it just fell short.  My sea bass & side dish tasted very salty, as if they solely drenched in soy sauce?! However; the service was the best I experienced anywhere by far. Maybe it was an off day with the food, let's hope so..",2015-05-29,Friday,,Tampa,FL,33607,"27.9602024049,-82.5183134644"

I had the parmesean chicken which is quite garlicky and a tad greasy. My ""loaded"" baked potato was not so loaded. Tiny bit of butter, tinier bit of sour cream, couple flakes of cheese and bacon. Very sad little potato. Salad was standard issue.

Hubs had a burger which he asked to have cooked medium, but got well done instead. 

On the bright side they have Coke products including Pibb and we had a most excellent server!",2013-07-08,Monday,,Woodbury,PA,08096,"39.8294954893,-75.1010690904"

Big comfy booths, a gorgeous bar area with orange and strawberry infused vodkas displayed in large glass urns.

Terrific iced tea and REAL lemonade.
Tast flatbreads, sandwiches (at lunch) and fish dishes.

Never disappointed here.
Great on a date or for lunch with the girls.",2014-05-04,Sunday,,Cherry Hill,PA,08002,"39.9403603389,-75.0264621411"

I'm talking about a noise level that bordered on painful which prevented the four of us, sitting in a booth, from carrying on a conversation.
