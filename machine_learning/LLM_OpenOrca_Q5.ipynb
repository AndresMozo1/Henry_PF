      "My husband and I have traveled the world.  We are in Tampa now.  While visiting the area we decided to stop in and check out this restaurant.  What a wonderful dining evening meal.  We would rate this restaurant as one of the top dining experiences we have had anywhere.  Jackie took care of us giving us a \"you are family\" experience.  She gets a 11 on a 1 - 10 scale.  Our food was perfectly prepared and very reasonably priced.  We will make it a point to come back to the Longhorn Restaurant in Tampa, Florida.\n",
